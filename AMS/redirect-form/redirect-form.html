		<p><strong>Additional U.S. information </strong></p>

		<p>
			The Combination relates to the securities of a UK company and is subject to UK procedural and
			disclosure requirements that are different from those of the United States. Any financial
			statements or other financial information included in this Microsite may have been prepared in
			accordance with non-US accounting standards that may not be comparable to the financial
			statements of US companies or companies whose financial statements are prepared in accordance
			with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. It may be difficult for US
			holders of shares to enforce their rights and any claims they may have arising under the US
			federal securities laws in connection with the Combination, since Redrow and Barratt are
			located in a country other than the United States, and some or all of their officers and
			directors may be residents of countries other than the United States. US holders of shares may
			not be able to sue Redrow and Barratt or their respective officers or directors in a non-US
			court for violations of the US securities laws. Further, it may be difficult to compel Redrow,
			Barratt or their respective affiliates to subject themselves to the jurisdiction or judgment
			of a US court.
		</p>

		<p>
			Any securities to be issued by Barratt as consideration in the Combination (the “<strong
				>Barratt Securities</strong
			>”) have not been, and will not be, registered under the US Securities Act of 1933, as amended
			(the “<strong>US Securities Act</strong>”), or under the laws of any state of other
			jurisdiction of the United States, and may only be offered, sold or resold in the United
			States in reliance on an exemption from the registration requirements of the US Securities
			Act.
		</p>

		<p>
			The Combination is intended to be implemented by way of a scheme of arrangement provided for
			under English company law (a “<strong>Scheme</strong>”). A transaction effected by means of a
			Scheme is not subject to the tender offer rules under the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
			as amended (the “<strong>US Exchange Act</strong>”), and the offer of securities of Barratt as
			consideration is exempt from the registration requirements of the US Securities Act. If the
			Combination is effected by way of a Scheme, any Barratt Securities would be expected to be
			issued to shareholders of Redrow in reliance upon the exemption from the registration
			requirements of the US Securities Act provided by Section 3(a)(10) thereof. In addition,
			Barratt Securities will not be registered under any US state securities laws and may only be
			issued to persons resident in a state pursuant to an exemption from the registration
			requirements of the securities law of such state.
		</p>

		<p>
			Alternatively, the Combination may be implemented by way of a takeover offer. If Barratt
			exercises its right to implement the Combination by way of a takeover offer, it is expected
			that such offer will be made in compliance with all applicable US tender offer (including
			Regulation 14E under the US Exchange Act) and exemptions provided under Rules 14d-1(c) or (d)
			under the US Exchange Act, and that the offer and sale of Barratt Securities will only be made
			to persons resident or located in the United States pursuant to exemptions from the
			registration requirements of the US Securities Act (if available).
		</p>

		<p>
			In accordance with normal UK practice and pursuant to Rule 14-5(b) of the US Exchange Act,
			Barratt or its nominees, or its brokers (acting as agents), may from time to time make certain
			purchases of, or arrangements to purchase, Redrow shares outside of the US, other than
			pursuant to the Combination, until the date on which the Combination and/or Scheme becomes
			effective, lapses or is otherwise withdrawn. These purchases may occur either in the open
			market at prevailing prices or in private transactions at negotiated prices. Any information
			about such purchases will be disclosed as required in the UK, and will be reported to a
			Regulatory Information Service and will be available on the London Stock Exchange website at
			<a href="http://www.londonstockexchange.com" target="_blank" title="Opens in new window"
				>www.londonstockexchange.com</a

		<p><strong>Forward-Looking Statements</strong></p>

		<p>
			This Microsite and the Information contained in it may contain certain forward-looking
			statements with respect to the financial condition, results of operations and businesses of
			Redrow and its subsidiaries and subsidiary undertakings (together, the “<strong
				>Redrow Group</strong
			>”) and Barratt and its subsidiaries and subsidiary undertakings (together, the “<strong
				>Barratt Group</strong
			>”).
		</p>

		<p>
			All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be,
			forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations
			that are based on management's current expectations and assumptions and involve known and
			unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or events to
			differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking
			statements include, among other things, statements concerning the potential exposure of Redrow
			and the Redrow Group to market risks and statements expressing management’s expectations,
			beliefs, estimates, forecasts, projections and assumptions, including as to future potential
			cost savings, synergies, earnings, cash flow, return on capital employed, production and
			prospects. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases
			such as "anticipate", "believe", "could", "estimate", "expect", "goals", "intend", "may",
			"objectives", "outlook", "plan", "probably", "project", "risks", "seek", "should", "target",
			"will" and similar terms and phrases.
		</p>

		<p>
			There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Redrow and the Redrow
			Group and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in any
			forward-looking statements included in this Microsite. These factors include, but are not
			limited to: UK domestic, European and global economic and political conditions (including the
			current conflict in Ukraine, the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and the repercussions of the
			UK’s withdrawal from the European Union); market-related risks such as fluctuations in
			interest rates and foreign exchange rates; the policies and actions of governments, central
			banks and regulatory authorities (including changes related to capital and solvency
			requirements, whether in the UK, Europe or globally); the impact of competition, inflation,
			deflation; the timing impact and other uncertainties of future acquisitions or offers within
			relevant industries; and the impact of tax and other legislation or regulations in the
			jurisdictions in which the Redrow Group and its affiliates and the Barratt Group and its
			affiliates operate.
		</p>

		<p>
			All forward-looking statements contained in this Microsite are expressly qualified in their
			entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should
			not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional factors that may affect
			future results are contained in Redrow’s latest annual report, interim results, trading
			updates and other announcements (available at Redrow’s corporate website). These factors
			should also be considered by the reader.
		</p>

		<p>
			Each forward-looking statement speaks only as at the specified date of the relevant document
			within which the statement is contained. None of Redrow, the Redrow Group, Barratt or the
			Barratt Group undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking
			statement as a result of new information, future events or other information. In light of
			these risks, results could differ materially from those stated, implied or inferred from the
			forward-looking statements contained in this Microsite.
		</p>

		<p>
			Unless expressly stated otherwise, no statement contained or referred to in this Microsite is
			intended to be a profit forecast.
		</p>
