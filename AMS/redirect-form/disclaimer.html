					UNDULY ONEROUS (A "RESTRICTED JURISDICTION").
				</p>

				<p>
					THIS MICROSITE CONTAINS ANNOUNCEMENTS, DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION (THE "INFORMATION")

					Viewing the Information you are seeking to access may be restricted under securities laws
					in certain jurisdictions. All persons resident outside of the United Kingdom (the "UK")
					who wish to view the Information contained in this Microsite must first satisfy themselves

				<h2>Additional U.S. information</h2>
				<p>
					The Possible Offer relates to the securities of a UK company and is subject to UK
					procedural and disclosure requirements that are different from those of the United States.
					Any financial statements or other financial information included in this Microsite may
					have been prepared in accordance with non-US accounting standards that may not be
					comparable to the financial statements of US companies or companies whose financial
					statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
					United States. It may be difficult for US holders of shares to enforce their rights and
					any claims they may have arising under the US federal securities laws in connection with
					the Possible Offer, since AMS is located in a country other than the United States, and
					some or all of their officers and directors may be residents of countries other than the
					United States. US holders of shares may not be able to sue AMS or its respective officers
					or directors in a non-US court for violations of the US securities laws. Further, it may
					be difficult to compel AMS and its respective affiliates to subject themselves to the
					jurisdiction or judgment of a US court.
				</p>

					All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be,
					forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future

					performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these
					statements.
				</p>

				<p>
					There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of AMS and the AMS
					Group and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the
					forward-looking statements included in this Microsite. These factors include, but are not
					limited to: price fluctuations in respect of particular product/s; changes in demand for
					AMS products; currency fluctuations; loss of market share and industry competition;
					environmental and physical risks; the risk of doing business in developing countries and
					countries subject to international sanctions; legislative, fiscal and regulatory
					developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; economic and
					financial market conditions in various countries and regions; changes in trading
					conditions; the ability of AMS to successfully retain key employees; changes in general
					economic, business and political conditions, including changes in the financial markets;
					and compliance with extensive government regulation.
				</p>

					All forward-looking statements contained in this Microsite are expressly qualified in
					their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section.
					Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.
