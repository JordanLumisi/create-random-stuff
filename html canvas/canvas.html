            Note: Canvas content is not accessible to screen readers. If the canvas is purely decorative, 
            include role="presentation" on the <canvas> opening tag. Otherwise, include descriptive text as 
            the value of the aria-label attribute directly on the canvas element itself or include fallback 
            content placed within the opening and closing canvas tag. Canvas content is not part of the 
            DOM, but nested fallback content is. 
        -->

				For accessibility, add fallback content within the Canvas element. This can be a static img
				using the HTML img tag or plain text content. This content will only render when a browser
				cannot render the canvas element or a user is using a screen reader. If the canvas is purely
				presentational then fallback content isn't always needed.
